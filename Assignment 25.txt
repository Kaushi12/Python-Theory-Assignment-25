1) Square brackets are lists while parentheses are tuples.
2) Iterators are the objects that use the next() method to get the next value of the sequence. A generator is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using a yield statement. Classes are used to Implement the iterators. Functions are used to implement the generator.
3) If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.
4) In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function.
5) List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required).
